# DLP TTP Comp
## Mini-project
Interested in getting started with the comp? Here's a small project to set up your development environment and do a little bit of hacking to brush up on your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

### Setting up
First, let's get your development environment set up. Open up [Mac Dev Setup guide](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup). Do the following steps:
- [iTerm2](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup#iterm2)
- [Homebrew](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup#homebrew)
- [Git](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup#git)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup#nodejs)

Feel free to do other steps as well!

That'll get you some of the core tools you'll need for web development, including git and node. But we'll need a few more ones; run the following in your terminal:

```sh
npm install -g yo bower gulp
```

Grab a copy of the [Atom](http://atom.io/) text editor. I highly recommend it and will be using it for the purposes of this comp.

### Learn
There are a few key concepts you should understand before you start hacking:
- **Git**. Try [this interactive introduction to git](https://try.github.io) if unfamiliar.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. There are [useful code snippets](week1/notes.md) in this repo, but you can also try [HTML Dog](http://htmldog.com/) and [JS for Cats](http://jsforcats.com).

### Hacking time!
Now that you're set up, here's the fun part: building some missing functionality in our sample flashcard app using your [newfound knowledge of HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript](week1/notes.md).

We've created a [sample webapp](https://github.com/hathix/dlp-webapp) for you to build off of. First, you'll need to make your own copy of the webapp so you can work with it. On our sample webapp's page, find the _Fork_ button and hit it to "fork" your own copy.

Now get a copy on your own machine. Find the HTTPS clone URL on the page of your fork of the webapp; it should be something like _[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<YOUR_USERNAME>/dlp-comp.git_. Then run:

```sh
git clone <URL>
```
